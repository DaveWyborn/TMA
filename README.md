# TMA

The is an experimental version of my website build almost entirely by AI using ChatGBT. 

For this version I'm specifically directing the style and design of the site but leaving ChatGBT to do all the coding and generating the CSS.

So far I've been very impressed with the output.   The website is fast, responsive and the design is good.  For what took an afternoon it far better than I could ever have achieved without AI.
However, the code is not perfect.   I'm not a developer but even I can tell.  I had to specifcally keep reminding ChatGBT to use the CSS file and not litter the code with styling. 
Even then I don't think its as clean as it could be if done by a professional.

That said, the end product is good.  It works well and you'd never tell unless you looked under the hood.


I'm working on a seperate project, this will be public and live, a website entirely designed by AI.  Styling, design and code.  I'll update the link here when its ready to go live.
